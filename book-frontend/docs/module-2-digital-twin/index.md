# Digital Twin for Humanoid Robotics (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to the Digital Twin module! This educational resource covers physics-based digital twins for humanoid robots using Gazebo and Unity, specifically designed for AI students building simulated humanoid robots.

## Overview

A digital twin in robotics is a virtual replica of a physical robot that mirrors its behavior, characteristics, and responses in real-time. For humanoid robots, this includes:

- **Physical properties**: Mass, dimensions, joint constraints
- **Dynamic behavior**: Movement and responses to forces
- **Sensor data**: LiDAR, cameras, IMUs
- **Environmental interactions**: How the robot responds to its surroundings

This module will guide you through three essential areas:

### 1. Physics Simulation with Gazebo
- Understanding gravity, collision detection, and dynamic responses
- Creating realistic physics environments for humanoid robots
- Simulating real-world physics that mirror actual robot behavior

### 2. High-Fidelity Environments with Unity
- Creating visually realistic 3D environments for robot training
- Implementing advanced lighting and textures
- Developing human-robot interaction scenarios

### 3. Sensor Simulation
- Simulating various robot sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)
- Generating realistic sensor data that matches physical sensors
- Understanding how sensor data affects robot perception

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the concept of digital twins in robotics
