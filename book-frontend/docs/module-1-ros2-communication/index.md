# Module 2: ROS 2 Communication Patterns

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand ROS 2 communication mechanisms including nodes, topics, and services
- Work with Python (rclpy) concepts to control humanoid robots
- Implement basic communication patterns for robot control systems

## Overview

Communication is the core mechanism by which ROS 2 systems interact. Understanding nodes, topics, and services is essential for practical implementation of robot control systems. This module covers the fundamental communication patterns used in ROS 2.
