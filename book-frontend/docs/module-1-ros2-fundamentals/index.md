# Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals for Physical AI

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the purpose and architecture of ROS 2 in the context of humanoid robotics
- Describe how ROS 2 functions as middleware for connecting AI agents to physical systems
- Understand the role of ROS 2 in embodied intelligence systems

## Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

In the context of humanoid robotics and embodied AI, ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" that connects different components of a robot, allowing them to communicate and coordinate effectively.
