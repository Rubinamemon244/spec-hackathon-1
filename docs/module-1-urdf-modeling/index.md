# Module 3: Humanoid Modeling with URDF

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Create and work with URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) models for humanoid robots
- Understand links, joints, and frames in URDF models
- Map software representations to physical hardware in humanoid robots

## Overview

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is an XML format used in ROS to describe robot models. For humanoid robots, URDF is essential for representing the robot's physical structure, including links (rigid parts), joints (connections between parts), and frames (coordinate systems).

## Key Concepts

### Links, Joints, and Frames

## Summary

This module introduced URDF modeling for humanoid robots, covering links, joints, frames, and their mapping to hardware. This knowledge is fundamental for robot simulation and control.

## Next Steps

Continue to the next section to learn more about creating specific URDF models for humanoid robots.
