# Learning Objectives and Outcomes for ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Module Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:

1. **Explain ROS 2 Architecture**: Articulate the purpose and architecture of ROS 2 in the context of humanoid robotics
2. **Describe Middleware Role**: Explain how ROS 2 functions as middleware for connecting AI agents to physical systems
3. **Understand Embodied Intelligence**: Describe the role of ROS 2 in embodied intelligence systems
4. **Implement Basic Nodes**: Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes using Python (rclpy)
5. **Use Communication Patterns**: Demonstrate understanding of fundamental communication concepts

## Specific Learning Outcomes

### Outcome 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals
- Students can explain what ROS 2 is and why it was developed
- Students understand the differences between ROS 1 and ROS 2
- Students can describe the DDS-based architecture of ROS 2

### Outcome 2: Middleware Concepts
- Students understand how ROS 2 serves as middleware in robotics systems
- Students can explain the role of ROS 2 in connecting AI agents to physical systems
- Students understand the distributed nature of ROS 2 communication

### Outcome 3: Embodied Intelligence
- Students can define embodied intelligence and its relevance to robotics
- Students understand how ROS 2 facilitates embodied intelligence
- Students can describe the sensor-actuator loop in robotic systems

## Assessment Criteria

### Knowledge Assessment
- Students can explain the architecture of ROS 2
- Students can describe the role of DDS in ROS 2
- Students understand the concept of nodes, packages, and the build system

### Application Assessment
- Students can create a basic ROS 2 node
- Students can implement simple publisher/subscriber patterns
- Students can demonstrate the connection between AI and hardware

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:

- Basic programming knowledge in Python
- Understanding of general robotics concepts
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Basic understanding of distributed systems concepts (helpful but not required)

## Duration

This module is designed to take approximately 2-3 hours to complete, depending on the student's prior experience with robotics and middleware concepts.

## Next Steps

After mastering these fundamentals, students should continue with the ROS 2 Communication Patterns module to learn about practical implementation of ROS 2 communication mechanisms.
