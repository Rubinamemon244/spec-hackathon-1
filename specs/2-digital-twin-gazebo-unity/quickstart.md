# Quickstart: Digital Twin for Humanoid Robotics (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview
This guide will help you get started with the Digital Twin educational module covering Gazebo physics simulation, Unity environments, and sensor simulation for humanoid robots.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments (helpful but not required)
- Interest in digital twin concepts for robotics

## Learning Path
The module is organized into three progressive chapters:

### Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo
- Understanding digital twin concepts
- Setting up Gazebo simulation environment
- Configuring gravity, collision, and dynamics
- Running basic physics simulations

### Chapter 2: High-Fidelity Environments with Unity
- Creating realistic 3D environments
- Setting up rendering pipelines
- Implementing human-robot interaction scenarios
- Optimizing for computer vision training

### Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation
- Understanding different sensor types (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)
- Configuring virtual sensors on robot models
- Analyzing sensor data outputs
- Validating sensor simulation accuracy

## Getting Started
1. Begin with Chapter 1 to understand the fundamentals of digital twins and physics simulation
2. Progress to Chapter 2 to learn about high-fidelity environment creation
3. Complete with Chapter 3 to master sensor simulation techniques

Each chapter includes practical examples and exercises to reinforce learning concepts.
