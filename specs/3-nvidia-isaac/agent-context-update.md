# Agent Context Update

## Status: Manual Update Required

The automated agent context update script (.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1) was not available due to missing PowerShell environment.

## Technologies to Add to Agent Context

The following NVIDIA Isaac technologies should be added to the agent's knowledge base:

- NVIDIA Isaac Sim: Photorealistic simulation environment using USD format
- Isaac ROS: Hardware-accelerated perception algorithms for ROS2
- Nav2: Navigation stack for path planning and obstacle avoidance
- ROS2 Humble: Middleware for robotics applications
- USD (Universal Scene Description): Scene representation format
- GPU-accelerated perception: VSLAM, stereo vision, and other algorithms
- Humanoid robot navigation: Path planning specific to legged robots

## Integration Notes

This educational module combines simulation, perception, and navigation in a cohesive learning experience. The agent should be aware of the interconnections between Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 for providing accurate educational content.
